I came back to this today and ran into the issue again. I was able to use the above command to determine which 
Python Ansible was invoking and then was able to pip install hvac into the correct environment.
ansible -m debug -a 'var=ansible_playbook_python' localhost

localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_playbook_python": "/usr/local/Cellar/ansible/2.6.0/libexec/bin/python2.7"
}
source /usr/local/Celler/ansible/2.6.0/libexec/bin/activate
pip install hvac



I get this issue all the time, I resolved it by setting ansible_python_interpreter in my hosts inventory to be my python 
installation where hvac was installed (as opposed to system python on OSX which is a completely different python 
(/usr/bin/python vs /usr/local/bin/python). None of the above solutions worked for me but this did:

    [targets]
    localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python
