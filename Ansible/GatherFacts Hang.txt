When gathering facts hang, most probably is the filesystem is unable to list

ls /  --> Face hanging here

Ansible cannot quickly gather facts

The setup module (when run automatically at the beginning of an ansible-playbook run, or when run manually as 
ansible -m setup <host>) can often hang when gathering hardware facts (e.g. if getting disk information from hosts with high i/o, bad mount entries, etc.).

Solution: try running 

$ ansible -m setup -a gather_subset=!all <destination>. If this works, you should consider setting this line in your ansible.cfg:

gather_subset=!hardware
