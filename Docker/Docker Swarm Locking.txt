Initialize a swarm with autolocking enabled
When you initialize a new swarm, you can use the --autolock flag to enable autolocking of swarm manager nodes when Docker restarts.

$ docker swarm init --autolock

Swarm initialized: current node (k1q27tfyx9rncpixhk69sa61v) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-0j52ln6hxjpxk2wgk917abcnxywj3xed0y8vi1e5m9t3uttrtu-7bnxvvlz2mrcpfonjuztmtts9 \
    172.31.46.109:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-WuYH/IX284+lRcXuoVf38viIDK3HJEKY13MIHX+tTt8
Store the key in a safe place, such as in a password manager.

When Docker restarts, you need to unlock the swarm. You will see an error like the following and services will not start.

$ sudo service docker restart

$ docker service ls

Error response from daemon: Swarm is encrypted and needs to be unlocked before it can be used. Please use "docker swarm unlock" to unlock it.
Enable or disable autolock on an existing swarm

To enable autolock on an existing swarm, set the autolock flag to true.

$ docker swarm update --autolock=true

Swarm updated.
To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-+MrE8NgAyKj5r3NcR4FiQMdgu+7W72urH0EZeSmP/0Y

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
To disable autolock, set --autolock to false. The mutual TLS key and the encryption key used to read and write Raft logs will be stored unencrypted on disk. There is a trade-off between the risk of storing the encryption key unencrypted at rest and the convenience of being able to restart a swarm without needing to unlock each manager.

$ docker swarm update --autolock=false
Keep the unlock key around for a short time after disabling autolocking, in case a manager goes down while it is still configured to lock using the old key.

Unlock a swarm
To unlock a locked swarm, use docker swarm unlock.

$ docker swarm unlock

Please enter unlock key:
Enter the encryption key that was generated and shown in the command output when you locked the swarm or rotated the key, and the swarm unlocks.
