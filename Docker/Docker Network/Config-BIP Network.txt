The Docker Engine default bridge network is conflicting with our internal network hosts access. How do I 
configure the default bridge (docker0) network for Docker Engine to a different subnet?

You can configure the default bridge network by providing the bip option along with the desired subnet in the daemon.json (
default location at /etc/docker/daemon.json on Linux) file as follows:

{
  "bip": "172.26.0.1/16"
}
Then restart the docker daemon (sudo systemctl restart docker on systemd based Linux operating systems).

For further information on configuring the default bridge network and the options available, 
refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/custom-docker0/.
