ou can use getent, which comes with glibc (so you almost certainly have it on Linux). This resolves using gethostbyaddr/gethostbyname2, and so also will check /etc/hosts/NIS/etc:

getent hosts unix.stackexchange.com | awk '{ print $1 }'
Or, as Heinzi said below, you can use dig with the +short argument (queries DNS servers directly, does not look at /etc/hosts/NSS/etc) :

dig +short unix.stackexchange.com
If dig +short is unavailable, any one of the following should work. All of these query DNS directly and ignore other means of resolution:

host unix.stackexchange.com | awk '/has address/ { print $4 }'
nslookup unix.stackexchange.com | awk '/^Address: / { print $2 }'
dig unix.stackexchange.com | awk '/^;; ANSWER SECTION:$/ { getline ; print $5 }'
If you want to only print one IP, then add the exit command to awk's workflow.

dig +short unix.stackexchange.com | awk '{ print ; exit }'
getent hosts unix.stackexchange.com | awk '{ print $1 ; exit }'
host unix.stackexchange.com | awk '/has address/ { print $4 ; exit }'
nslookup unix.stackexchange.com | awk '/^Address: / { print $2 ; exit }'
dig unix.stackexchange.com | awk '/^;; ANSWER SECTION:$/ { getline ; print $5 ; exit }'
