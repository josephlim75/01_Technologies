To list the files in a package, use the repoquery utility, which is included in the yum-utils package. 
For example, the following command lists the files that the btrfs-progs package provides.

# repoquery -l btrfs-progs
/sbin/btrfs
/sbin/btrfs-convert
/sbin/btrfs-debug-tree
.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply prefix the package name that you want to keep with -. 
You need to add -- before the list of packages to ensure that the name of the package is not treated like an option:

yum remove *php* -- -php-common 


If the name starts with a - character, then a search is done within the transaction and any matches are removed.
